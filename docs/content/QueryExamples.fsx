We assume a locally configured SQL Srever database server with the database MyDatabase populated as shown 
on [this page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh225374.aspx).  All of the queries run correctly
with FSharpComposableQuery and produce the same answers as the main implementation of F# query.  This 
is because FSharpComposableQuery leaves query operations it doesn't recognize in place.
